module Papyrus
  # Custom commands are those which give you more flexibility over builtins as they let you
  # define any methods you want in a wrapper class that you can then mix into Papyrus's lexicon
  # at runtime. If a command is encountered in the template Papyrus will look for a corresponding
  # method in the wrapper class, calling it with the arguments of the command.
  #
  # Your wrapper class must inherit from CustomCommandSet, and then you pass an instance of it
  # to the Parser using its :custom_commands option.
  #
  # Custom commands can either be inline or block commands, which are located as methods in
  # a InlineCommands or BlockCommands module, respectively, inside your wrapper class.
